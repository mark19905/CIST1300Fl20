Each experience begins with a thorough consultation, followed by a tailored experience.</div>
    <div class="utdU2e" style="text-align: center;">Our salon is departmentalized, meaning we have color specialists and style specialists. When booking online, if you wish to receive both color and cut, please book accordingly.&nbsp;</div>
    <div class="utdU2e" style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Note: Hair consultations are always part of our colour services and are available complimentary prior to all first-time services.</div>
    <div class="utdU2e" style="text-align: center;">Our color services do not include a blow dry. We have fully-stocked styling stations for you to use to blow dry your own hair. *this is not available currently due to Covid-19* If you would like a full professional blow dry&nbsp;following your color service, please request this at the time of booking. An additional charge will be added for this service.
